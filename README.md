## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

<Inform the name of the existing tool that was executed and how it was executed>
Tool: tox + coverage.py /
Usage: The tool was used by following the guide on the contribute page of the project. We set up the development environment and run "tox" command, which run the full test suite using coverage.py. We found the result under "htmlcov/index.html" file name, which generated a file with the coverage (it can also be found in the terminal, however the html file is easier to read).

<Show the coverage results provided by the existing tool with a screenshot>
  <img src="readme_imgs/coverage_tool_run_1.png"
     alt="Coverage 1 before"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

  <img src="readme_imgs/coverage_tool_run_2.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

### Your own coverage tool

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>

<Function 1 name>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the instrumented code to gather coverage measurements>

<Provide a screenshot of the coverage results output by the instrumentation>

<Function 2 name>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Function 1>

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>

<Test 1>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>

<Test 2>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>

## Statement of individual contributions

<Write what each group member did>

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

<Inform the name of the existing tool that was executed and how it was executed>
Tool: tox + coverage.py <br />
Usage: The tool was used by following the guide on the contribute page of the project. We set up the development environment and run "tox" command, which run the full test suite using coverage.py. We found the result under "htmlcov/index.html" file name, which generated a file with the coverage (it can also be found in the terminal, however the html file is easier to read).

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Caio Miranda Haschelevici>

<Test 1 - hungarian.py>
   <Original cover results:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/header.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
   <img src="readme_imgs/Hungarian&Greek.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <New tests:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/newtestshung.png"
   alt="new test for hungarian.py"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <New covarage results:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/header.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
   <img src="readme_imgs/newcoverageresults.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <Overall we saw an improvement in coverage of 16% the main reason from this can be found when looking at the initial report generated by the coverage tool used. From what it shows the main reason for this low coverage where that the tests used always made the conditions on the if statement always true or false. Therefore, coverage wasnt very high due to the branch conditions not being checked by any individual test. My test checks each branch condition when its true or false thus determining if the branches would work properly during operation. Thus, increasing the coverage by 16%. It is also important to note that the functions coverage didnt increase further due to the inclusion of my own coverage tool into the function. The inclusion of this tool into the function itself caused alot of statements to go unused as they are exclusive statements to my own coverage tool. For example the area with tests for my own coverage tool.>

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>

<Test 2 - asctime.py>
   <Original cover results:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/header.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
   <img src="readme_imgs/Hungarian&Greek.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <New tests:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/newtestsasc.png"
   alt="new test for asctime.py"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <New covarage results:>
   <img src="readme_imgs/header.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
   <img src="readme_imgs/newcoverageresults.png"
   alt="Coverage 2 before"
   style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

   <Overall we saw an improvement in coverage of 17%, we saw this improvements because of a similar reason as the previous test. Just like in the previous case we had a low initial coverage because certain branches where either always true or always false with the pre-exisiting tests. However, the tests I added ensure that either case of every branch is tested and therefore we had an increase in the overall coverage of this function by 17%. Just like in the rpevious test case, it is important to note that due to the inclusion of my own coverage tool into the function, the coverage wasnt able to be higher. This is due to the fact that certain areas of the code where exclusive to my coverage tool and therefore not tested. Thus, hampering the overall coverage>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>
